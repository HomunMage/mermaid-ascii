# mermaid-ascii-py — Working Status

## Current Phase: Phase 0 (Project Scaffold)
## Status: NOT STARTED

## What's Done
- CLAUDE.md written with full project instructions
- scripts/ directory created with agent team scripts (start, orchestrator, worker, checkpoint, rollback, stop)
- llm.plan.status written with full 11-phase plan
- llm.working.status created (this file)

## What's Next
- Phase 0: Create pyproject.toml, directory structure, Dockerfile, .gitignore, examples, gen.sh
- Then Phase 1: AST dataclasses
- Then Phase 2: Grammar + Parser (the big one)
- Then Phases 3-8: Graph IR, Layout, Render
- Then Phase 9-10: Integration, examples, CI

## Blockers
None.

## Notes
- Reference Rust code is at ../mermaid-ascii-rust/src/
- All .mm.md example files need to be copied from ../mermaid-ascii-rust/examples/
- parsimonious PEG grammar will need careful translation from pest syntax
